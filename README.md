# Student Enrollment Form using JsonPowerDB

## Description
This project implements a web-based Student Enrollment Form that utilizes JsonPowerDB (JPDB) for data storage and retrieval. The form allows users to save, update, and reset student records with fields such as Roll-No, Name, Class, Birth-Date, , address and Enrollment Date. The application dynamically enables/disables form controls based on the existence of data in the database and validates input fields before any database operation.

- **Easy integration:** Simple API with JSON-based commands, making it fast to implement CRUD operations from client-side JavaScript.
- **Scalability:** Supports handling large volumes of JSON documents efficiently.
- **Fast development:** Reduces backend coding time and complexity.
- **Cross-platform compatibility:** Works well with web and mobile applications due to its RESTful API.
- **Real-time data:** Supports instant retrieval and update of records with minimal latency.
